  <h1>GlassLedger Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>GlassLedger is designed with your privacy in mind. We believe your financial data belongs entirely to you.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, share, or transmit any personal or financial data. All information you enter — such as paychecks, bills, and totals — is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> only.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your data stays on your device.</li>
    <li>We do not use external servers or cloud services.</li>
    <li>Deleting the app permanently removes all stored information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
  <p>GlassLedger does not use analytics tools, ads, or third-party integrations that track user behavior or collect personal information.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>GlassLedger does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13, since no user data is collected or transmitted.</p>

  <h2>Your Control</h2>
  <p>Because all data is stored locally, you have full control at all times. You can delete your information simply by removing the app from your device.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at:</p>
